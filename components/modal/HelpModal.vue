    <h3>What is mindmapper?</h3>
    <p>
      Mindmapper is a simple application to allow you to get everything out of
      your head and into an easy to use interface that will facilitate further
      work (i.e., essay writing or further study).
    </p>
    <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
    <p>It's pretty easy, check it out:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a new project.</li>
      <li>Fill in the name and main idea (thesis statement).</li>
      <li>Enter any subideas that you come across as you read.</li>
      <li>For each subidea, enter any counterpoints that come to mind.</li>
      <li>
        Think those counterpoints might be rebutted by a reader or opponent?
        Enter those, too.
      </li>
      <li>All done? Export to PDF and profit.</li>
    </ol>
